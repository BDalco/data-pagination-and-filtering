# data-pagination-and-filtering

In this project, I used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

I started with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. I started by using your JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. I also added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.
